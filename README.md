# Bank-Spring-Boot

🚀 Exciting Project - "BANK"! 🎉

I am thrilled to announce the completion of my latest project - BANK! 🌟

🎯 Project Details :

This Spring Boot application is designed for a banking system where users can register, log in, and manage their accounts. It features user authentication, account management, and transaction handling. The application uses a MySQL database to store user data and transaction history, and Thymeleaf for rendering the web interface.

💡 Key Features :

✅ User Management :<br>

   <b> Registration :</b> Users can create an account by providing necessary details.<br>
   <b> Login/Logout :</b> Users can log in with their credentials and log out when needed.<br>
   <b> Security :</b> Spring Security is used to handle authentication and authorization.

✅ Account Operations :<br>

   <b> Deposit :</b> Users can deposit money into their accounts.<br>
   <b> Withdraw :</b> Users can withdraw money from their accounts.<br>
   <b> Transfer :</b> Users can transfer money to other users if they know their username.
     
✅ Transaction History :<br>

   All transactions (deposits, withdrawals, transfers) are recorded in the system.<br>
   Each transaction includes details like transaction ID, type (deposit, withdrawal, transfer), amount, and date/time.

🛠 Technologies Used :

 **Spring Boot :** For the core application framework and managing application configurations.<br>
 **Spring Security :** To handle user authentication and authorization.<br>
 **Spring Data JPA :** To interact with the MySQL database and manage entities.<br>
 **Thymeleaf :** For rendering dynamic web pages and creating the user interface.<br>
 **MySQL :** As the relational database to store user information and transaction data.

🧐 Components :

 **Controllers :** Handle HTTP requests and responses for user actions (e.g., registration, login, transactions).<br>
 **Services :** Contain business logic related to user operations and transactions.<br>
 **Repositories :** Interface with the MySQL database to perform CRUD operations on user and transaction data.<br>
 **Models :** Define the structure of the data entities (User and Transaction).<br>
 **Configuration :** Set up Spring Security for authentication and authorization.

🎓 Workflow

 **User Registration :** Users can register via a web form, which is processed by a controller and saved to the database.<br>
 **User Login/Logout :** Spring Security manages user sessions and handles login/logout functionality.<br>
 **Account Transactions :** Users can perform deposit, withdrawal, and transfer operations through dedicated interfaces.<br>
 **Transaction Logging :** All transactions are recorded in the database with relevant details for auditing and tracking.

📝 Conclusion :

Successfully delivered a fully functional and engaging Bank Spring-Boot Application that demonstrates advanced front-end development skills. The project highlights expertise in creating interactive web applications, managing Front-End as well as Back-End Development.
