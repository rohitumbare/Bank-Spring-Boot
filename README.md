# Bank-Spring-Boot
This Spring Boot application is designed for a banking system where users can register, log in, and manage their accounts. It features user authentication, account management, and transaction handling. The application uses a MySQL database to store user data and transaction history, and Thymeleaf for rendering the web interface.
